# Problem 4: Model Serving

The objective of this problem is to build an API service that serves the trained predictive model. I have implemented an API service using Python and [insert API framework/library name] to achieve this goal. The API service provides an /predict endpoint that accepts input values for vol_moving_avg and adj_close_rolling_med and responds with the predicted trading volume.

To interact with the API service, you can make HTTP GET requests to the /predict endpoint with the appropriate parameters. Here's an example:

plaintext
Copy code
GET /predict?vol_moving_avg=12345&adj_close_rolling_med=25
The API server will process the request and return an integer value representing the predicted trading volume based on the trained model.

Deployment
The API service, along with the trained model, has been deployed using [insert deployment service]. You can access the deployed API service through the following link: [insert deployment link].

Usage
To utilize the API service, you can follow these steps:

Make a GET request to the /predict endpoint of the deployed API service.
Provide the values for vol_moving_avg and adj_close_rolling_med as query parameters in the request URL.
The API service will respond with the predicted trading volume as an integer value.
Please note that the provided example request URL is for demonstration purposes. You should replace the values of vol_moving_avg and adj_close_rolling_med with appropriate values according to your use case.
